                    <p>A reduction in design complexity give rewards in ease of use,
                        accessibility and performance â€“ for developers and people who use the software we create.</p>
                    <p>I write away bootstrap and third-party ui plugins from enterprise software at banks and FTSE100 companies, and replace them with clean sass libraries
                        and hand-rolled js components.</p>

                    <p>This incarnation of the library is a new work in progress (Feb 2021), however none of the
                        selector names
                        will change as standard html element naming conventions are used.</p>
